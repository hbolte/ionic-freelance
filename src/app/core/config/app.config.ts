  // about
  about: `Henrik is a passionate Software Engineer with focus on mobile applications for Android and iOS. Already during
          his studies of applied computer science at the University of Applied Sciences Braunschweig/Wolfenbüttel in
          Germany, he was involved in the development of Android applications in non-IT fields and thus not only acquired
          the basics but also evolved an affine interest.
          <br>
          <br>
          After successfully completing his studies, he gained first experiences as a permanent employee in the automotive
          sector at Neusoft, the largest software company in China, before he decided to become self-employed in 2018.
          The reasons are quite obvious. Henrik is a focused, independent and very ambitious person who always lives by
          the motto: “Don’t search for errors, search for solutions” (Henry Ford). His motivation is the constant search
          for interesting new challenges and the intention to offer companies professional consultation and solutions.
          <br>
          <br>
          In addition to native Android development he has
          also acquired extensive knowledge in Hybrid App Development. Through the use of e.g. web technologies in
          combination with a technical native background, Henrik has grown to a convinced expert in this area and
          has always been able to put his stamp on past and ongoing projects.`
